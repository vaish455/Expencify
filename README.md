## Database Schema

### Models
- **Company**: Organization data with currency
- **User**: Employees, managers, and admins
- **Category**: Expense categories
- **Expense**: Expense records with approval status
- **OcrData**: Extracted receipt data
- **ApprovalRule**: Approval workflow rules
- **ApprovalStep**: Sequential approval steps
- **ApprovalAction**: Approval/rejection history

## Approval Workflow Logic

### Manager Approval Priority
If `isManagerApprover` is checked for an employee, their manager MUST approve the expense first before it enters the main approval workflow.

### Sequential Approval
Expenses go through approvers one by one in defined order. Each approver must act before moving to the next.
Example:
- Step 1 ‚Üí Manager
- Step 2 ‚Üí Finance Head  
- Step 3 ‚Üí Director

### Percentage-based Approval
Expense is approved when X% of defined approvers approve. Example: If 3 out of 5 approvers approve (60%), expense is auto-approved.

### Specific Approver Rule
If a specific person (e.g., CFO, CEO) approves, expense is automatically approved regardless of other approvers.

### Hybrid Rule
Combines percentage and specific approver: approve if EITHER condition is met.
Example: Approve if (60% approve) OR (CFO approves)

### Combined Workflows
You can have BOTH sequential AND conditional rules active:
1. Manager approves first (if enabled)
2. Goes through sequential approvers
3. At any point, conditional rules (percentage/specific/hybrid) can auto-approve

### Rule Priority
Multiple rules can exist. Higher priority rules are checked first. This allows for complex approval hierarchies.
