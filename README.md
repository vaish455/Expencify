## Database Schema

### Models
- **Company**: Organization data with currency

- **Category**: Expense categories
- **Expense**: Expense records with approval status
- **OcrData**: Extracted receipt data
- **ApprovalRule**: Approval workflow rules
- **ApprovalStep**: Sequential approval steps
- **ApprovalAction**: Approval/rejection history

## Approval Workflow Logic

### Sequential Approval
Expenses go through approvers one by one in defined order.

### Percentage-based Approval
Expense is approved when X% of defined approvers approve.

### Specific Approver Rule
If a specific person (e.g., CFO) approves, expense is auto-approved.

### Hybrid Rule
Combine percentage and specific approver: approve if either condition is met.

### Manager Approval
If `isManagerApprover` is true, employee's manager must approve first before other rules apply.
